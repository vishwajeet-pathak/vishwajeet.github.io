<h1>Cost-Driven Design Decisions in Furniture Development</h1>

<p>
Good furniture design is not only about aesthetics or function — it is also about cost intelligence. The most successful products are those where design decisions actively support pricing targets and production efficiency.
</p>

<h2>Understanding Where Cost Comes From</h2>
<p>
Material choice, hardware count, finishing complexity, and assembly time all contribute to final product cost. Designers who understand these drivers can influence the product’s commercial viability from the very beginning.
</p>

<h2>Design Simplification</h2>
<p>
Reducing part variation, standardizing components, and aligning dimensions with material stock sizes can significantly lower production expenses. Often, small geometry adjustments create large cost savings.
</p>

<h2>Balancing Value and Quality</h2>
<p>
Cost-driven design does not mean compromising quality. Instead, it means optimizing the relationship between performance, durability, and manufacturing effort so that resources are used where they matter most.
</p>

<h2>Design as a Business Tool</h2>
<p>
In my experience, when design teams work closely with costing and production teams, products become more scalable and competitive. Cost awareness transforms design from an artistic exercise into a strategic business tool.

<h1>The Role of AI in Furniture Development</h1>

<p>
Artificial Intelligence is gradually transforming how furniture products are designed, documented, and brought to market. While AI does not replace human creativity, it significantly enhances decision-making and workflow efficiency.
</p>

<h2>Concept Exploration</h2>
<p>
AI tools can assist designers in generating variations, exploring layout options, and visualizing forms faster than traditional manual iteration. This accelerates early-stage ideation without compromising control over design direction.
</p>

<h2>Documentation and Communication</h2>
<p>
From generating descriptions and technical explanations to organizing product documentation, AI reduces the time spent on repetitive tasks. Designers can focus more on problem-solving and less on formatting information.
</p>

<h2>Market and Material Insights</h2>
<p>
AI can help analyze trends, compare materials, and support decision-making around features, pricing, and positioning. This strengthens the link between design thinking and market reality.
</p>

<h2>Human Intelligence Still Leads</h2>
<p>
Furniture design remains deeply connected to ergonomics, culture, craft, and user experience. AI acts as an assistant, not a replacement. The future belongs to designers who combine creative intuition with digital intelligence.
</p>

<p>
In my work, I see AI as a tool that expands design capability — helping bridge creativity, engineering logic, and production strategy.

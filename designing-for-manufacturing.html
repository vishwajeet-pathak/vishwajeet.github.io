<h1>Designing Furniture for Manufacturing Reality</h1>

<p>
Many furniture concepts fail not because of poor aesthetics, but because they ignore manufacturing realities. A successful product is one that survives the journey from sketch to shop floor.
</p>

<h2>Design vs Production</h2>
<p>
Designers often optimize for visual appeal, while manufacturers optimize for repeatability, cost, and process stability. The strongest products emerge when both perspectives are integrated early in development.
</p>

<h2>Material and Joinery Logic</h2>
<p>
Understanding machining limits, sheet sizes, hardware tolerances, and assembly sequences helps avoid redesign loops. Small design decisions can significantly impact production efficiency.
</p>

<h2>Cost Awareness</h2>
<p>
Every additional component, finish variation, or tooling requirement influences final cost. Designers who consider costing during concept development build products that are easier to scale.
</p>

<h2>Bridging the Gap</h2>
<p>
In my experience, the best solutions emerge when design intent, production planning, and vendor feasibility are aligned from the start. Furniture design becomes more powerful when it embraces manufacturing logic instead of resisting it.
